# FRONT_WebSiteTemplate
This is my first full website. It is done using only HTML,CSS and JS  
This is a template i created so it will have lots of commented out code that would be a sub  
There will also be lots of repeated HTML and CSS because each page with its own css can be used as a single page website later.  
  
This project was a learning project, its aim was to expand my CSS and JS usage and create templates that can be used later.
